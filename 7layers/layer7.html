	<div class="row">
		<p>Layer 7 is the Application Layer which is the top layer. It is for your applications like; Copilot, Steam, Microsoft Store, Google, Firefox, DuckDuckGo, etc.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<p class="shrt">Every Application uses layer 7 in some way. An example is File Explorer, if you put Network discovery on you can share files though your local network if given the proper security, and sometimes even select to control a device if also given proper security, and permission.  Another example is steam, when you launch steam you connect to their servers through the internet to access things like your achievements, games, and even profile settings. Layer 7 connects to the other levels for it to work. It requests network services and sends its users down the stack, while also receiving data back from them and presenting it in a readable format for the end user. It needs the Presentation layer for data formatting, it uses layer 5 to manage communication. 4 for making sure data gets there and checking for errors, layer 3 for where data to go. It uses 2 for framing the data, and 1 to actually send it. The reason why this is important for the user is so they can do basic things on a computer like use software that their company uses, share information like files or applications  to other users. The security of this layer is not the best and is vulnerable because it can only use Firewalls and WAFs(web application firewalls), regular software updates and patches.</p>
