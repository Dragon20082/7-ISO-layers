		<p class="shrt">Layer 5 is the session layer, which helps make connections, manage them and terminating them. Layer 5 also does dialogue control for making orderly data exchanged and synchronizing the connection.This is how layer 5  First it starts by an application/computer requesting for another one, then the session layer deals with the handshake which is used to set things like transfer speed, type of connection, ect; if needed layer 5 coordinates ongoing exchanges. will check who these two parities are, then sets up dialogue and makes sure it is synchronized before handing to layer 4. The session layer manages/maintenances connections by monitoring the connections and synchronizing it. Synchronization is when it sets up checkpoints into the data to coordinate communication and make it easy to recover if something happens to the connection.</p>
