		<p>Layer 6 is the Prestation layer and its job is to transform and format data for layer 7 making stuff compatible between different systems. It uses different formatting types to make data be able to be sent to others, be able to take less space and/or shorten the time it takes to go by making it smaller so you can send more. This helps applications like Google, Steam, the Xbox app, and Discord be able to talk to a computer from another computer.  An example is file manager, when you have network discovery on you sometimes share files and layer 6 makes sure it is in a format that all computers can use.</p>

		<p class="shrt">Layer 6 has many functions, one of them being formatting, which is where you take data and change it to something readable. It also encrypts and decrypts data in formats that computers know so layer 7 can show to the user. Compression is where you format data in a way that makes it smaller, and decompression is where you take compressed data and then unformat the format that compressed it and use a format the computer uses.</p>
		<p class="shrt">It ensures compatibility between systems by using formats that every computer uses and knows. Some of these formats are Jpeg, MP4, gif, pdf, ect.</p>

		<li>XDR:(eXtended Data Representation)</li>
		<p>Is a standard format used for sending data between different devices.</p>
		<li>ICA:(Independent Computing Architecture)</li>
		<p>A protocol by Citrix that allows you to run applications or desktops on a server while sending the display to your device</p>
		<li>MIME: (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)</li>
		<p>Allows you to transmit more than text though email like images, audio, other apps, etc.</p>
		<li>ASN.1(Abstract Syntax Notation One)</li>
		<p>Defines how a data structure should be described using a standard. This allows systems to exchange data reliably.</p>
