Hello
This was the original plan
but google where being a few words
they where blocking the js file
they made it file:///C:/Users/nickv/Documents/7%20layers/layers.js instead of file:/C:/Users/nickv/Documents/7%20layers/layers.js
There was a google extension to fix it
But google said no
it was needed for it to run
the project_Ideals was what I had plan
thanks for looking for the easter egg
oh and google F__K u for destroying what I wanted and wasting my time when I could have done something else and been done
